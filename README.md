# POP2-HANGMAN
Programset 00

Author: Jason Fortik

Function: A take on the classic hangman game. I used OOP to create a hangman class that controls the game and a player class to keep track of user statistics. 

Date: April 09, 2021

How To Play: The user will enter characters one by one to try to guess the word that was randomly generated by the pc. 
The user must guess the word in 10 attempts or less on easy and hard mode, or 13 attempts or less in normal mode. 
The user statistics will be tracked for 10 games. The words generated are completely random and will never follow a pattern.
